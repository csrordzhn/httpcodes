## Httpcodes

The idea behind this project is to have the http codes as a searchable list in your code or usable in pry
instead of going to wikipedia, search for codes. In the end, its all about saving you some clicks.
The list of codes is coming from http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes-1.csv
